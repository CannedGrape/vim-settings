grep
====

Plugin to integrate various Grep search tools with Vim

The grep plugin integrates the grep, fgrep, egrep, agrep and silver
searcher (ag) tools with Vim and allows you to search for a pattern in
one or more files and jump to them.

To use this plugin, you need the grep, fgrep, egrep, agrep, ag, find and
xargs utilities. If a particular utility is not present, then you cannot
use the corresponding features, but you can still use the rest of the
features supported by the plugin.

These tools are present in most of the Unix installations.  For
MS-Windows systems, you can download the GNU grep and find utilities
from the following sites:

   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/grep.htm<BR>
   http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/findutils.htm

If you want to use the Silver Searcher (ag) with this plugin, then you can
download it from:
